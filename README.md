## About Craft CMS
Craft CMS is a content-first CMS that aims to make life enjoyable for developers and content managers alike. Craft doesnâ€™t make any assumptions about your content, or how it will be presented, so developers can spend their time building exactly what they need, rather than fighting with a pre-built theme.
